# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# Every config option has reasonable defaults unless it is labeled as "required."
# All paths are relative to the directory that Snakemake is executed in.
# Note: this file is written in the YAML syntax (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)


# The path to a text file specifying where to find images (with a .JPG ending) for each sample
# Each row in the sample file should represent a different sample.
# The sample file should have 3 columns (each separated by a single tab):
#       <unique_sample_name> <path_to_images> <image_ext>
# Here's an example:
#       test  data/test .JPG
# Note that <image_ext> is optional. If it isn't provided (ie there is no tab
# after <path_to_images>, the ext will be inferred based on the most common
# file extension among the files in the <path_to_images> dir. If <image_ext>
# is blank (ie there is a trailing tab but no ext), all of the files in the
# <path_to_images> directory will be assumed to be images.
# required!

# Whether to perform the default strategy or the experimental one
# The default strategy performs segmentation on the stitched orthomosaic, while
# the experimental strategy parallelizes the segmentation step by running it on
# each of the original images.

# the default strategy will be used

# Whether to perform the stitching step with low quality settings (true)
# instead of high quality ones (false). The high quality settings are usually
# only helpful if you plan to perform segmentation and classification on the
# orthomosaic. Using low quality settings can significantly improve the running
# time and memory usage of the stitching step.

#     2) the species labels (currently: 0 or 1 for whether the plant is buckwheat)
#     The TSV file should not have a header line.
# train_all (optional) - Whether to train on all of the data in the truth set or use half
#     of the data for training and half for testing. If this line is commented out
#     or set to a falsey value, the truth set will be split in half. Otherwise,
#     the testing steps will be skipped.
